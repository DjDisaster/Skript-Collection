Some useful skripts, will be added to.

[HTTP.sk](https://github.com/DjDisaster/Skript-Collection/blob/main/HTTP.sk) - Allows you to receive http requests from external sources.<br>
[Dialog.sk](https://github.com/DjDisaster/Skript-Collection/blob/main/Dialog.sk) - Allows you to use dialogs. You must be on server version 1.21.10. Other ones will not work due to API changes. <br>Example script: : https://pastebin.com/PYKyr0vy<br>

Feel free to make an issue if you have suggestions or find a bug.
